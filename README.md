# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python

A collection of jupyter notebooks to practice Data Structures and Algorithms concepts in Python.

**This repo is a work-in-progress.**

Started as a means for me to practice and keep track of basic DSA concepts. 

Not taking contributions for now. Will be opened for contributions once the initial set of DSA concepts and practice questions are added.
